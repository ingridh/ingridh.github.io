			<div class="smalltitle blacktitle">Project 1 - OKR (Objective and Key Results) Tool</div>
				<div class="bodysection">
				<div class="smalltitle"> The Challenge </div>
				<p>My main project for this internship was working on an internal tool for the entire MongoDB company. The challenge given was to create a web application that they could launch the next quarter for the entire company to track their objective and key results. This was because MongoDB was growing so big so rapidly, they needed a way to keep the company working together towards a unified goal despite the growing numbers. (More info on what is a OKR <a href="https://library.gv.com/how-google-sets-goals-okrs-a1f69b0b72c7#.8ojmsfth1" target="_blank"> here</a>). This meant everyone from the engineering to the marketing team to even the executive board would be using this product in a few short months. I along with another intern basically ran this entire project ourselves as lead designer and developer respectively. The PM called it 'a startup within a startup.' </p>

				<div class="smalltitle"> Initial Research and Prep</div>
				<p> We started with evaluating and writing out the design specs on what the project should entail. The developer looked at possible technologies we can build the application on top of and I looked at competitors such as 7Geese and Betterworks, entire companies with entire teams that worked on this one product that we were tasked to finish in less than 2 months.</p> 

				<p>Before this project, the company had just started doing OKRs; however, everything was organized in tabs in multiple Google spreadsheets which made the process time consuming and hard to use especially for managers that had to look through multiple sheets. Many of my initial interviewees from the survey I sent out equated this process to filing taxes - a necessary evil that you just want to get it over. From my competitive analysis, it looked like the other companies had too many features that we did not need such as a newsfeed feature or even the ability to award badges and send encouragement to one another. We wanted this tool to be a productivity tool, not a social media tool! </p>

				<div class="smalltitle"> Wireframes </div>
				<p>I started with sketching before doing a simple lo-fi version on Sketch to present to the PM on the status of the designs to gather feedback.</p>

				<div class="smalltitle"> Lo-fi Interactive Mockups </div>
				<p>Adding a little color in. I designed specific interaction flows given the feedback and also plugged the screens into inVision so I could user test them.</p>

			<div class="smalltitle blacktitle">Project 2 - User Persona Research</div>
			<div class="bodysection">
				<div class="smalltitle"> The challenge </div>
				<p>Before I started the OKR project, I was tasked to redo MongoDB's user personas they had for their products. The company was rapidly creating new products; however, even though their products have expanded and diversified; they had not updated their user personas for awhile. This is a small project in which I learned how to contact and interview both internal stakeholders (from people on my team to the marketing director to the head of entire departments) as well as external customers whom I approached at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/world16">MongoDB World</a>, the company's annual conference. </p>

				<div class="smalltitle"> What I learned </div>
				<p> Personas aren't cookie cutter. There is going to be overlap and edge cases that you have to figure out if it is one person or an unaccounted group you need to include. When I would make user personas in school or when I worked on smaller projects, my users were pretty specific and disjointed from each group. Since MongoDB is releasing more products for both tech and nontech people, they now have a wide range and rapidly expanding users from those who were trained in software engineering to those who might be technical PMs or just a hobbyist. I learned how to interview many different types of people and how to quickly ramp up to understand MongoDB's multiple products in a short amount time. I do not have something visual to show for this project, but feel free to contact me for further informations or questions.</p>

			<div class="smalltitle blacktitle">Summary</div>
				<div class="bodysection">
				<p>This summer in New York taught me more than how to cram myself into the 1 train to get to work and that you should never buy Broadway tickets at the Times Square TKTS station because the Seaport one has no wait and just as wide of a selection.</p>

				<p>This summer in New York at MongoDB has challenge me to grow both as a designer and also as a developer. I applied for this internship with MongoDB because I wanted to see what it was like working in-house at a tech company that was produced products for a niche group of technical users but it turned out for MongoDB's products as well as for the project I worked on, there were many more type of users and edge cases than I expected.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, I learned 
					<ol>
						<li><b>Work fast to test often.</b> Iterate quickly so you can have enough time (especially on a project that was timeboxed for such a short time) to change things as you get more feedback. By the last 3 weeks or so when we realized we had to work even faster so we could have the MVP ready in time - that's when I jumped in and started designing directly by styling the css and working on the jquery to help push it to the live application.</li>
						<li><b>Don't be afraid to fail.</b> Even though the amazing design team at MongoDB already had set branding guidelines and conventions, they were also constantly innovating which allowed me to be creative with my design choices as well. In the beginning, I constrained myself, thinking I should keep things simple and standard in fear of making something that might be 'wrong' or 'ugly'. But I actually learned the most when I did miss an edge case or had to go back to fix something (or redo entire views) after user testing and feedback sessions. In addition, designing something that might not be exactly the same as everyone else on the team is okay! The team brought you in for a fresh perspective and if you didn't showcase your ideas, what's the point of that? </li>

				<div class="smalltitle"> The Task </div>
				<p>I'm currently working designing/redesigning the iPad app for Azimo. Azimo is a company that focuses on mobile first, with its two designer focusing on the redesign of the Android and iOS and also working on the website on the side. However, the iPad app, although available, is merely the iPhone app but bigger. There is a lot of white space and padding on the side of the screens to compensate for the empty space on a bigger screen as there have not been anything designed specifically for the iPad for awhile (if at all). However, the space also allows, as I have been learning, the chance to display information in different ways as well more room to be creative!</p>
				
				<p>I have actually never designed something specifically for the iPad as well. It's a different set of challenge from designing for phone as you have much more space for fill, but you still have to remember the touch screen and keyboard constraints that doesn't usually come with websites. In addition, since Azimo is an international company, I always have to remember to leave room for languages like Russian in which three words in English might be a sentence length long.</p>

			<div class="smalltitle blacktitle">Launching Invite Friend</div>
				<img class="workimg" src="../img/azimophones.png">
				<p> As of end of October, the screens I have been working on for the recent sprint has been launched in the app store! Azimo has completely rebranded their app and I was tasked with one of the four tabs on the main screen - the Invite Friend page. The screen, despite it's simplicity, is an crucial way for the company to gain more users and thus more customers. The initial design (the one on the left) was the old design that did not work with their new branding anymore. The final design that I worked on is the on the right in which you can now see on the app store, live! </p>

				<p> Azimo has this rewards program in which the more people you invite, the more money you will get - but the problem was how to represent this in a way that will convey the message to users quickly and effectively? Through iteration and feedback sessions, I used iconography, copy, and layout that was simple enough for users to understand at a glance and letting the action items (the buttons) be obvious.
				</p>


				<div class="smalltitle"> Next Steps </div>
				<p>I am working on the finishing touches of the iPad design and am hoping to have it launched soon. In addition, through user feedback on the currently launched app, we should be able to see if the new Invite Friend really brings in new users or not. I will update this page as my internship progresses, but feel free to reach out and I can update you what I have been doing this week :)</p>

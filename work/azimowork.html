				<p>I'm currently working designing/redesigning the iPad app for Azimo. Azimo is a company that focuses on mobile first, with its two designer focusing on the redesign of the Android and iOS and also working on the website on the side. However, the iPad app, although available, is merely the iPhone app but bigger. There is a lot of white space and padding on the side of the screens to compensate for the empty space on a bigger screen as there have not been anything designed specifically for the iPad for awhile (if at all). However, the space also allows, as I have been learning, the chance to display information in different ways as well more room to be creative!</p>
				
				<p>I have actually never designed something specifically for the iPad as well. It's a different set of challenge from designing for phone as you have much more space for fill, but you still have to remember the touch screen and keyboard constraints that doesn't usually come with websites. In addition, since Azimo is an international company, I always have to remember to leave room for languages like Russian in which three words in English might be a sentence length long.</p>

				<div class="smalltitle"> Next Steps </div>
				<p>I am working on the finishing touches of the iPad design and am hoping to have it launched soon. I will update this page as my internship progresses, but feel free to reach out and I can update you what I have been doing this week :)</p>

			<p class="subtitle">This is a project where I challenged myself to create a brand new e-commerce product page user experience from scratch within a week.</p>

			<div class="smalltitle blacktitle">Introduction</div>
				<div class="bodysection">
					<div class="smalltitle"> The purpose behind lightcapture</div>
					<p><b>lightcapture</b> was a personal project I undertook to design an e-commerce page for a physical product. I gave myself the time constraint of one week with time at the end of the week to user test and ask for feedback. </p>

					<p>As someone does freelance photography, camera product pages are places I frequent. However, these pages take a lot of time to sift through, and it requires almost a learning curve and background knowledge of technical camera specs as well as additional research elsewhere to be able to fully form a comprehensive summary and understand a singular product. For the average user who does not want to shell out thousands for the wrong camera and gear, it’s really hard to figure out what kind of camera you want without tons of time and research. <b>lightcpature</b> provide a solution to this by utilizing what the average consumer already knows (Instagram/social media) to provide an introduction to the gear behind it.</p>

					<p>This page is also kind of an ‘anti-design’ project. One thing I (and other photographers) frequently hear is the phrase, “Wow, your photos are so nice - what kind of camera do you use?” This phrase is equivalent to asking a builder what kind of hammer he or she uses or a programmer what kind of text editor produces such beautiful code. This is the wrong way to approach buying gear, but that doesn’t mean that people don’t do this already. This project plays on this idea by (literally) cashing in this idea and using this misconception to sell gear that promises to enhance your Instagram game if you drop a few hundred if not thousand dollars for the top gear. After all, the better gear you have, the more likes you’ll get on Instagram, right? </p>

					<p>Some features I included: title, multiple photos, description, rating, reviews, user uploaded photos, price, shipping info, stock info, and buy/add to cart. </p>

					<div class="smalltitle">Target Users</div>
					<p>The target users include: 
						<ul>
							<li> beginners to photography </li> 
							<li> people who do not fully understand/care about camera technical specs</li>
							<li> people who are active on social media (esp. Instagram) </li>
							<li> people who have GAS (gear acquisition syndrome) who are easily tempted into buy more camera gear than they need</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<div class="smalltitle">Branding</div>
					<p>Some of the key branding guidelines I made up for myself. The focus of this project was the ideation and the user experience so I didn't spent a whole lot of time on branding. Icons are from nounproject.</p>

					<p>The ‘light’ or sun highlights ‘apt' in the title to hint at how buying on lightcapture is enough and good. The color yellow represents light.</p>

					<p>*I recognize some styles are the same as my portfolio website.. this is the style I currently personally love :) </p>

					<div class="smalltitle">Not Logged In</div>
					<p>This is the landing page you (the user) see when you first enter the site. In this case you are not logged in.</p>

					<p>The user can still browse and buy, but the page is just not personalized to you when you first arrive. Login is through Instagram. Future collaboration can be done with other photo sharing sites or even Youtube (video sharing).</p>

					<p>The main driving point is through the search bar in the middle of the page which fits the goal of the website (see about page). However there is also a search bar on the top which is for easy user experience nav purposes throughout the site. </p>

					<p>If the product was real, I would A/B test to see which search bar works better and what people actually use. I had some trouble deciding how the navigation would work because I want the uesr to have the freedom to access individual product pages without going through user images. However, this also creates a dual search bar on a singular page which I'm not sure if is an overkill or not.</p>

					<img class="lightc workimg" src="../img/lightcapture/1landingpage.png">

					<div class="smalltitle">Not Logged In - Hover State</div>
					<p>This is the hover state when you hover over any photo on this page. </p>

					<p>The names of the camera and lens are clickable links to the specific product pages or you can see both products side by side (not pictured) if you click on the setup link on the bottom.</p>

					<p> All images are credited via photographer and pulled from Instagram given the photographer's account is public. Photos taken with any camera contains the device’s data.</p>

					<img class="lightc workimg" src="../img/lightcapture/2landinghover.png">

					<div class="smalltitle">Logged In</div>
					<p>This is the landing page when you are logged in.</p>

					<p> The discovery is catered to your feed and what the site remembers you bought in the past. Here, Fujifilm cameras are highlighted because the user either 1) searched about Fujifilm before or 2) owns Fujfilm products. Another idea I had (not designed) is when you set up your profile, you have the option to ‘add your gear’ which will help personalize your feed. (Think netflix).</p>

					<p>The 'Explore New Gear' section on the bottom is a general explore/discovery tailored to people you haven’t seen before.</p>

					<p>This is the feed page when you log in (if you don’t log in, this page would just be empty state asking you to login to get started).
					It mirrors your Instagram (IG) feed but it summarizes what gear is on your feed to entice you to look into these products. The tags above are clickable to individual product page, organized by most used to least.</p>

					<p>Possible future exploration and iteration include customization of the organization of tags</p>

					<p>When you search through the sentence construction seach box you have the option to discover what your favourite photographershoots with. Currently you can only select one. Future iterations include maybe &amp; function to look at more than one.</p>

					<p>Settings is less about buying but more about learning photography. However, knowing how amazing one’s camera settings are can also encourage purchases. Possible expansion include an education side to this website!</p>

					<p>Notes: 
						<ul>
							<li>Setup means all - lens, camera, everything the photographer used.</li>
							<li>The photographer search box is pulled from how Instagram searches users.</li>

				<p>The search bar collapses on to the top bar. The top search becomes an icon. Will expand if clicked on though. You can click on the tags, the links, or the camera images to get to the product page. </p>

				<p> Here the main goal is to get to the product page and buy some cameras!</p>

			<div class="smalltitle blacktitle">Final Thoughts</div>
				<div class="bodysection">
					<p>After I designed everything and laid out the basic description and navigation. I sent this to four people to user test. Two of them were photographers with varying degrees of experience, one was not a photographer but active on Instagram, and one was a beginner photographer. 

					<p>To the two people with less experience in photography, the photos were really enticing and ‘nice to look at’ and one remarked it was interesting to ‘stalk their favorite photographers’ and figure out their setup. One photographer remarked this site was ‘very bad for his wallet’ because it only made him want to buy more gear even though he had the knowledge to understand that his own gear was technically fine. The people with more experience used the search bar on top more because they knew what they were looking for while the beginners and the user who was not a photographer liked browsing through photos more. </p>

					<p>Most people (especially the people who were just hobbyists) unfortunately bypassed the what _ equipment does _ use? search bar because they felt they did not know specific photographers to search people by name. Another point of criticism was that the photos were a little overwhelming and looked ‘all the same, though all very nice’ to someone who had little experience which still created the barrier of where to start?  Would this replace one’s Instagram feed altogether? Also, there was confusion in how the photos were ordered since I did not have a timestamp or singular timeline flow as seen on Instagram.</p>

					<p>Another point to think about is what this would look like on mobile. Wouldn't this just look like Instagram?</p>

					<p>Overall, I did not have as much time as I would have to properly test this. In addition, if I were to really test the full effect of the site, I would need to have the feed/logged in state reflect the user’s own feed to provide the full effect. </p>

					<p>Originally I only wanted to redesign a typical product page for practice but this project morphed into.. this. It was really interesting to challenge myself to play on a common misconception to ideate on a possible new way of selling products. Feel free to send me feedback or comments! </p>
